# Online Bus Ticket Booking System

The Online Bus Ticket Booking System is a web-based application that allows users to search for buses, book tickets, manage bookings, and update their personal information. Users can search for available buses without logging in, register for an account, and log in to book tickets. They can also cancel bookings and update their personal details, such as passwords.

- **Bus Search:** Users can search for available buses based on their departure and arrival locations, date, and time preferences.
- **User Registration and Login:** Users can register for an account to book tickets and log in with their credentials.
- **Ticket Booking:** Registered users can book bus tickets based on the availability of seats.
- **Booking Management:** Users can view their booked tickets, cancel bookings, and check the status of their reservations.
- **Profile Management:** Users can update their personal information, including password changes and contact details.
